# TwoMatch
Easy pattern and front-end to match two datasets manually.

## The Concept
Sometimes matching two datasets is very painful. Where fuzzy matching doesn't work perfectly, or the process needs some creative 
powers that technology cannot provide now. TwoMatch comes to the rescue my augmenting the computation powers from computer
with the creative and sensible decision making of a human. 

## How it works
- You upload two data sets, and a pre-computed adjancy matrix (or a small subset of it). 

- TwoMatch will provide you with an interface where it provides humans with a one element in one of the datasets 
with the most likely matches in the other dataset. 

- The human (using one click) tells TwoMatch the right match. 

- TwoMatch stores this information, where it can be extracted easily afterwards.
